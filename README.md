# CS509 Airline Reservation System 

The proposed system will perform the functions of a Travel Agent, and eventually be able to shunt customer load from Travel Agents to the proposed system. The system will provide a front for Retail Customers to interface with World Plane Incorporatedâ€™s database so that customers can search for flights, see details about flights, and reserve flights.

The app is written in Java with a console based UI on a remote server established by the lecturer of WPI CS509, and is conceptually similar in behavior to existing web-based airline reservation systems such as kayak.com or expedia.com.

The system allows user to:
*  Search either non-stop flights or connecting flights with a maximum of two layovers by defining the departure/arrival airport, departure/return date, trip type, and seat class.
*  View search results with correct flight information.
* Sort and filter search results.
* Reserve either one-way or round-trip flights.
* Reserve selected flight(s) and receive reservation confirmation from the system.
