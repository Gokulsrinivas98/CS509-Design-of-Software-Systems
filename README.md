# CS509 Airline Reservation System 

The proposed system performs the functions of a Travel Agent, and shunts customer load from Travel Agents to the proposed system. The system provides a front for Retail Customers to interface with World Plane Incorporatedâ€™s database so that customers can search for flights, see details about flights, and reserve flights.

The app is written in Java with a console based UI on a remote server established by the lecturer of WPI CS509, and is conceptually similar in behavior to existing web-based airline reservation systems such as kayak.com or expedia.com.

The system allows user to:
-  Search either non-stop flights or connecting flights with a maximum of two layovers by defining the departure/arrival airport, departure/return date, trip type, and seat class.
  -   The system takes care of the layover times and shows all times wrt the local airport     
- View search results with correct flight information.
- Sort and filter search results.
- Reserve either one-way or round-trip flights.
- Reserve selected flight(s) and receive reservation confirmation from the system.
